#AI Trainer - Pose Estimation and Counter
------------------
This project is an AI-based trainer that uses pose estimation to track the movement of key joints during exercises like dumbbell curls. The system calculates the angle of the arm and keeps count of the number of repetitions performed, providing real-time feedback in the form of on-screen overlays.
